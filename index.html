    <p>     Blue whales are the largest baleen whale species--in fact they are the largest animal in the world.  Blue whales can grow to be about 100 feet in length and may weigh around 160 tons. They are mottled bluish gray, with broad flat heads and a small dorsal fin located in the last forth of the body. Blue whales are a cosmopolitan species with a wide-spread distribution in most of the world’s oceans. They can be found in both coastal and pelagic waters. Due to commercial whaling, their global population has been significantly reduced; at present it is unclear how many blue whales remain in the ocean due to their large range and dispersal, as well as low sampling efforts. In Canada, blue whales are present on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Through studying distinctive calls it is believe that there are at least two distinct populations within the north Pacific; one occupies the western and central north Pacific, while the other occupies the eastern north Pacific.

        <p>Mostly all whale species are believed to have evolved from terrestrial hoofed mammals like cows, camels, and sheep some 45 million years ago. Recent comparisons of some milk protein genes have confirmed this relationship and have suggested that the closest land-bound living relative of whales may be the hippopotamus. Throughout their evolution, whales have become perfectly suited to an aquatic environment, and are virtually incapable of leaving it.  Whales have undergone several changes or adaptations needed to fare well in their watery home. Their bodies have become streamlined for efficient movement through the water.

        <p> Blue whales appear to be migratory, spending summer month in higher latitudes and winter in lower. Some tropical areas, however, have shown certain whales present year round, indicating possible non-migratory blue whales. The whales that frequent the waters off British Columbia are most likely the same whales that feed off California in the summer/fall and spend the winter months in Mexico and Central America. They are capable of covering long distances in short periods of time; one animal was documented travelling from the Queen Charlotte Islands to the Santa Barbara Channel, a distance of 2500km in 28 days or less. Researchers are able to identify individual blue whales by the pigmentation and mottling patterns on their flanks. Much of this photo-identification has taken place in California, a hotspot for blue whale sightings. In 2007, researchers from Fisheries and Oceans Canada spotted 5 different blue whales off of Haida Gwaii in British Columbia.
    Blue whales feed on zooplankton, most commonly a variety of euphasiid (krill) species, as well as some copepods. Blue whales are a ‘rorqual’- meaning they have pleats along their throat. This allows them to expand their throat while feeding, and then expel salt water through their baleen, which acts as a food sieve. To feed, blue whales lunge through swarms of krill, sometimes on their side or back. This may be observed above water, but most surface-feeding probably happens at night, when krill concentrations rise in the water column.

        <P>The blue whale is the largest mammal, possibly the largest animal. An average blue whale is 24 meters long, and weighs about 99,800 kg, and females are even larger than males of the same age, the largest may weigh as much as 136,000 kg. The body is long, somewhat tapered, and streamlined, with the head making up less than one-fourth of its total body length. Its rostrum is very broad and flat and almost U-shaped, with a single ridge that extends just forward of the blowholes to the tip of the snout. The blowholes are contained in a large, raised “splash guard ”, and the blow is tall and straight and over 6 m high, sometimes as much as up 10 m high. Their body is smooth and relatively free of parasites, though barnacles attach themselves to the edge of the fluke and occasionally to the tips of the flippers and to the dorsal fin. There are about 60 ventral grooves or pleats extending from the lower jaw to near the navel.
<br>
            The blue whale is blue-gray in color, often with lighter gray mottling on a dark background or with dark spots on a light background. The underside of the flippers may be a lighter color or white, while the ventral (topside) side of the fluke is dark. The ventral side of its body is often yellow-green in color because blue whales graze on microorganisms called diatoms in the cold waters of the Antarctic, North Pacific and North Atlantic. Because of this yellowcolor, the early whalers nicknamed blue whales “sulphur bottom.”

        <p>Blue whales are found in all oceans of the world. They mate and calve in tropical-to-temperate waters during winter months and feed in polar waters during summer months. Blue whales in the northern hemisphere move north to Arctic waters to feed; blue whales in the southern hemisphere move south to the Antarctic to feed. Nearly all the southern hemisphere population may be found in the summer feeding grounds in the Antarctic.

        Blue whales are the largest predator to ever inhabit this planet, though it is thought to feed almost exclusively on tiny, shrimp-like creatures called euphausiids or krill. Feeding is usually at depths less than 100 m; harpooned animals have dived as deep as 500 m. During the summer feeding season the blue whale gorges itself, consuming an astounding 3,600 kg or more each day. This means it may eat up to 40 million krill a day. Baleen whales, they have a series of 260-400 fringed overlapping plates hanging from each side of their upper jaw where teeth would otherwise be located. These plates consist of a fingernail-like material called keratin that frays out into fine hairs on the ends near their tongue. The plates are black and measure about 51 cm in length toward the front of their mouth to about 102 cm at the rear. During feeding, large volumes of water and food are taken into the mouth and the pleated grooves in their throat expand enormously. As their mouth closes, water is expelled through the baleen plates, which trap the food inside to be swallowed.

        <p>Whales often spend summers feeding in polar waters and undertake lengthy migrations towards the Equator as winter arrives. These graceful swimmers cruise the ocean at more than five miles an hour but accelerate to more than 20 miles an hour when they are agitated. Blue whales are among the loudest animals on the planet. They emit a series of pulses, groans, and moans, and it’s thought that, in good conditions, blue whales can hear each other up to 1,000 miles away. Scientists think they use these vocalizations not only to communicate, but, along with their excellent hearing, to sonar-navigate the lightless ocean depths.

        <p>At the turn of the twentieth century whaling became a massive industry. Blue whales were killed for blubber, oil, and meat. The harpoon gun paved the way for whale populations to decrease. An estimated 90% of the blue whale population was killed due to whaling. Today, there are 10,000 to 25,000 blue whales remaining. During the 1960’s the International Whaling Commission banned blue whale hunting. However, nations such as Norway and Russia have ignored this ban, and blue whale meat continues to show up in fish markets, primarily in Japan.
